"""Which embedder fills an index, as a vault declares it.

A vault's `hql.toml` owns its index, and an embedder is how an index comes to
exist, so `[semantics.embedder]` lives there rather than in a third file or in
flags a contributor has to remember. Only this producer reads the table: the Rust
consumer has no model to configure, and reads what produced a score out of the
index rather than out of configuration.

Nothing here reaches a network or loads a model. It parses, merges and refuses.
